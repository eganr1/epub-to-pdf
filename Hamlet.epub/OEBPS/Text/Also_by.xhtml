    <p class="body">From the unforgettable to the obscure, Words of the Presidents relives the defining moments of American history from 1776 to 2011. From Gettysburg to Berlin; from “all men are created equal” to “ask not what your country can do for you”; from the Monroe Doctrine to the military-industrial complex, these words illustrate the thoughts and feelings of a country as its role shifts domestically and on the world stage. The collection also includes many less well-known works, such as Jefferson’s correspondence with the Cherokee, John Quincy Adams’ arguments in the Amistad case, James Madison’s proposed draft of the Bill of Rights, and debates from the hard-fought three-way 1912 election between Teddy Roosevelt, William H. Taft, and Woodrow Wilson.</p>

    <p class="body">This collection includes 53 of the most important, the most powerful, and the most fascinating statements from the pens and podiums of the United States presidents. You’ll also find paintings, photos, and political cartoons, along with footnotes and commentary on each speech from the Bookbyte Digital editors.</p>

    <p class="chtitle"><span>THE COW OF GUECKEDOU</span></p>

    <div class="rsmallpic"><img alt="" src="../Images/cowsmall.jpg" /></div>

    <p class="body"><span>Paul Rippey lived in Africa for twenty years with his wife and four children through coups d'état in four countries, many weird diseases, and lots of inconvenience. He captures some of the flavor of this time in this book of sixteen short chapters written in Conakry Guinea, where most of the stories take place.</span></p>

    <p class="body"><span>The stories tell of traditional magic involving a donkey's anus; the Frenchman who had to wrestle with a devil and stuff him into a bottle; a cow that exploded in the middle of the night into a taxi full of unhappy passengers; a bag full of human heads that upset overzealous customs officials; and Paul's experiments with the powder-that-makes-you-disappear-in-one-place-and-reappear-instantly-someplace-else.</span></p>

    <p class="body"><span>Every story is true, and people who have lived in West Africa who read these stories often smile and say things like, "Yes, exactly! Something just like that happened to me one time!" (On the other hand, people who have no experience with West Africa tend to think the stories are bizarre fiction.)</span></p>

    <p class="body"><span>Among contemporary works on Africa, it is safe to say that <span class="sgc-1">The Cow of Gueckedou</span> is a lot funnier than <span class="sgc-1">Heart of Darkness</span> or <span class="sgc-1">King Leopold's Ghost</span>, and has a much happier ending than <span class="sgc-1">The Poisonwood Bible</span>. It's a take on life in Africa from someone who loves the continent and its people, and who remembers the absurdity more than the inconvenience of his travels into the interior.</span></p>
