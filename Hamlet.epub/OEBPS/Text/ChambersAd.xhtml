  <p class="centend"><span class="sgc-1">Funny, heartbreaking, little-known, and deeply personal true stories from World War II</span></p>

  <p class="para1"><span>The Isle of Wight, located off the southern coast of England, was bombed relentlessly during Britain's darkest days of World War II. Author and artist John Howard Worsley recreates the home front experience, cobbled together from his personal experience and interspersed with individual tales of courageâ€” some comic and some tragic. These stories are compiled in this multimedia collection, including original photos and paintings, as well as links to five short documentaries created by the author. Worsley takes a unique and personal look at a life and an island hurt by war, and the healing that comes after it.</span></p>
